# Not My Code!

I got a lot from this person's [ECC/secp256k1 article](https://onyb.gitbook.io/secp256k1-python/).

And so I stole the [corresponding gists](https://gist.github.com/onyb/cf795c819fdf8aa6015de2772fde24de) and made it a python package for my own selfish needs.

The source here is identical to that found in the above git repo.

I may find myself doing other, maybe pythonization-related things but rest assured, I did none of the hard stuff!
